Refactored:
    - Added input prompts for users to know what to input. This is implemented within the users view classes.
    Within the classes they are told to type in a number for the action they want (Emily). Within the main method,
    when inputting the users role they are prompted to input a "CourtClerk", "Judge", "Defendant", or "Public" (Julian).
    - Added feedback to users. In the actors view classes, the users receive feedback when they have been logged in by
     telling the user "You are now logged in." Additionally, in the main, if the user does not enter the right
     information, they are told their input is invalid and to try again (Emily).
    - Added an MVC structure to the project (Emily).
    - Created a fascade in main method to store all cases. This allows all users with different roles to access cases
    (Julian).
    - Adjusted authentication functionality by storing the usernames and passwords in a hashmap to ensure that when users
    attempt to log on it will verify with already created usernames and passwords.(Ryan)
    - Removed unused imports, made code style and spacing more consistent, enhanced readability (Nick)
    - Changed some behavior in the menus so that the program does not log out the user after performing an action (Nick)
